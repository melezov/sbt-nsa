Usage: scaladoc <options> <source files>
where possible scaladoc options include:
  -author                                     Include authors.
  -diagrams                                   Create inheritance diagrams for classes, traits and packages.
  -diagrams-dot-path <path>                   The path to the dot executable used to generate the inheritance diagrams. Eg: /usr/bin/dot
  -diagrams-dot-restart <n>                   The number of times to restart a malfunctioning dot process before disabling diagrams (default: 5)
  -diagrams-dot-timeout <n>                   The timeout before the graphviz dot util is forcefully closed, in seconds (default: 10)
  -diagrams-max-classes <n>                   The maximum number of superclasses or subclasses to show in a diagram
  -diagrams-max-implicits <n>                 The maximum number of implicitly converted classes to show in a diagram
  -doc-footer <footer>                        A footer on every ScalaDoc page, by default the EPFL/Typesafe copyright notice. Can be overridden with a custom footer.
  -doc-format:<format>                        Selects in which format documentation is rendered (html) default:html
  -doc-generator <class-name>                 The fully qualified name of a doclet class, which will be used to generate the documentation
  -doc-no-compile <path>                      A directory containing sources which should be parsed, no more (e.g. AnyRef.scala)
  -doc-root-content <path>                    The file from which the root package documentation should be imported.
  -doc-source-url <url>                       A URL pattern used to link to the source file; the following variables are available: €{TPL_NAME}, €{TPL_OWNER} and respectively €{FILE_PATH}. For example, for `scala.collection.Seq`, the variables will be expanded to `Seq`, `scala.collection` and respectively `scala/collection/Seq` (without the backquotes). To obtain a relative path for €{FILE_PATH} instead of an absolute one, use the -sourcepath setting.
  -doc-title <title>                          The overall name of the Scaladoc site
  -doc-version <version>                      An optional version number, to be appended to the title
  -expand-all-types                           Expand all type aliases and abstract types into full template pages. (locally this can be done with the @template annotation)
  -groups                                     Group similar functions together (based on the @group annotation)
  -implicits                                  Document members inherited by implicit conversions.
  -implicits-hide:<implicit(s)>               Hide the members inherited by the given comma separated, fully qualified implicit conversions. Add dot (.) to include default conversions.
  -implicits-show-all                         Show members inherited by implicit conversions that are impossible in the default scope. (for example conversions that require Numeric[String] to be in scope)
  -no-link-warnings                           Avoid warnings for ambiguous and incorrect links.
  -no-prefixes                                Prevents generating prefixes in types, possibly creating ambiguous references, but significantly speeding up scaladoc.
  -raw-output                                 For each html file, create another .html.raw file containing only the text. (can be used for quickly diffing two scaladoc outputs)
  -skip-packages <<package1>:...:<packageN>>  A colon-delimited list of fully qualified package names that will be skipped from scaladoc.

Additional debug settings:
  -diagrams-debug                             Show debugging information for the diagram creation process.
  -implicits-debug                            Show debugging information for members inherited by implicit conversions.
